## Local development

### Technical requirements

Ensure you install these modules globally on your development machine:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Webpack Dev Server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html)


### Installation

Once you checked out this project, run this command in a Terminal window:

    npm install


### Hosts file

Ensure that this entry is present in your [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)):

    127.0.0.1 dpd-monitor.local

### How to run site during development

1. Run this command in a Terminal window:

        webpack-dev-server

2. Open a browser at [http://dpd-monitor.local:6464/](http://dpd-monitor.local:6464/) to view the project.

From this point on, you can edit the files in the `src` directory and the browser will update automatically when you save your changes.


## Deployment to Raspberry Pi

### Build project on local development machine

Before deploying the monitor interface to the Raspberry Pi, ensure that the project is built locally:

1. Check out the project from the repository

2. Follow the following instructions of the "Local Development" section above:
    a. Technical Requirements
    b. Installation

3. Run this command in a Terminal window: `webpack`. It will compile the interface assets into the appropriate directory.


### Package build

Once you ensured that you have a build of the project, run this command in a Terminal window:

    npm run package

In the case where there is no build, the command will fail.

The command above archive a `.zip` file of the necessary assets into the `assets/archives/` directory. The `.zip` file is always appended with the date at which the file is created.

This archive is what needs to be deployed to the Raspberry Pi.


### Deploy build

There are a few ways to deploy files onto the Raspberry Pi, however the most efficent one would be to use the `scp` Unix command in a Terminal.

    scp <local-file> <username>@<ip>:<remote-path>

Let's show an example. Let's assume the following:

- The Terminal window is opened from the root of the project directory;
- The Pi IP address is `10.10.10.10`;
- The Pi credentials are still at the default settings*:
    - Username: `pi`
    - Password: `raspberry`

The command would then read

    scp assets/archives/dpd-monitor-2017-07-24.zip pi@10.10.10.10.:/home/pi/www

If the Terminal prompts for a password, use the one associated with the username.

\* For security reasons, these credentials should be changed for a production environment.

From this point it's a simple matter of unarchiving the `.zip` file in the `/home/pi/www` directory of the Pi.
